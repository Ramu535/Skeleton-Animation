# Full-Body Skeleton Tracking with Mediapipe and OpenCV

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to track and display a full-body skeleton, including the torso, arms, legs, and face mesh. The application draws the skeleton in white over a black background and can process live webcam input.

## Features
- Full-body skeleton tracking using Mediapipe's Pose module.
- Face mesh rendering with Mediapipe's Face Mesh module.
- Hand tracking and connections with Mediapipe's Hands module.
- Real-time video feed processed and displayed in a web browser.
- Custom enhancements like a shaded torso and neck line for realistic visualization.
